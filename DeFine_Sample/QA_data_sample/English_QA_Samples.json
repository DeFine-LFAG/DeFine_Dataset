Please provide detailed answers with a minimum of 300 words: What is the treatment for malnutrition, and how can it help in treating diarrhea?", "input": "", "output": "Food and drink can help prevent dehydration in malnourished people with diarrhea. Eating (or breastfeeding, among infants) should resume as soon as possible.Sugary beverages like soft drinks, fruit juices, and sweetened teas are not recommended as they may worsen diarrhea.Malnourished people with diarrhea (especially children) should be encouraged to drink fluids; the best choices are fluids with modest amounts of sugar and salt, likevegetable brothor saltedrice water. If clean water is available, they should be encouraged to drink that too. Malnourished people should be allowed to drink as much as they want, unless signs of swelling emerge.Babies can be given small amounts of fluids via an eyedropper or a syringe without the needle. Children under two should receive a teaspoon of fluid every one to two minutes; older children and adults should take frequent sips of fluids directly from a cup.After the first two hours, fluids and foods should be alternated, rehydration should be continued at the same rate or more slowly, depending on how much fluid the child wants and whether they are having ongoing diarrhea.If vomiting occurs, fluids can be paused for 5–10 minutes and then restarted more slowly. Vomiting rarely prevents rehydration, since fluids are still absorbed and vomiting is usually short-term.If prevention has failed and dehydration develops, the preferred treatment is rehydration throughoral rehydration therapy(ORT). In severely undernourished children with diarrhea, rehydration should be done slowly, according to the World Health Organization.Oral rehydration solutions consist of clean water mixed with small amounts of sugars and salts. These solutions help restore normal electrolyte levels, provide a source ofcarbohydrates, and help with fluid replacement.Reduced-osmolarityORS is the current standard of care for oral rehydration therapy, with reasonably wide availability.Introduced in 2003 by WHO and UNICEF, reduced-osmolarity solutions contain lower concentrations of sodium and glucose than original ORS preparations. Reduced-osmolarity ORS has the added benefit of reducing stool volume and vomiting while simultaneously preventing dehydration. Packets of reduced-osmolarity ORS include glucose, table salt,potassium chloride, andtrisodium citrate. For general use, each packet should be mixed with a liter of water. However, for malnourished children, experts recommend adding a packet of ORS to two liters of water, along with an extra 50 grams ofsucroseand some stock potassium solution.People who have no access to commercially available ORS can make a homemade version using water, sugar, and table salt. Experts agree that homemade ORS preparations should include one liter (34oz.) of clean water and 6 teaspoons of sugar; however, they disagree about whether they should contain half a teaspoon of table salt or a full teaspoon. Most sources recommend using half a teaspoon of salt per liter of water.However, people with malnutrition have an excess of body sodium.To avoid worsening this symptom, ORS for people with severe undernutrition should contain half the usual amount of sodium and more potassium.Patients who do not drink may require fluids bynasogastric tube.Intravenousfluids are recommended only in those who havesignificant dehydrationdue to their potential complications, includingcongestive heart failure."}

These blocks can then be subjected todiscrete cosine transform(DCT) to calculate the frequency components, both horizontally and vertically.The resulting block (the same size as the original block) is then pre-multiplied by the quantization scale code and divided element-wise by the quantization matrix, and rounding each resultant element. The quantization matrix is designed to provide more resolution to more perceivable frequency components over less perceivable components (usually lower frequencies over high frequencies) in addition to transforming as many components to 0, which can be encoded with greatest efficiency.  Many video encoders (such asDivX,Xvid, and3ivx) and compression standards (such asMPEG-2andH.264/AVC) allow custom matrices to be used. The extent of the reduction may be varied by changing the quantizer scale code, taking up much less bandwidth than a full quantizer matrix.This is an example of DCT coefficient matrix:A common quantization matrix is:Dividing the DCT coefficient matrix element-wise with this quantization matrix, and rounding to integers results in:For example, using −415 (the DC coefficient) and rounding to the nearest integerTypically this process will result in matrices with values primarily in the upper left (low frequency) corner. By using a zig-zag ordering to group the non-zero entries andrun length encoding, the quantized matrix can be much more efficiently stored than the non-quantized version."}

Bush administrationto serve for the entirety of his eight years.She was also the longest-serving Secretary of Labor sinceFrances Perkins, who served from 1933 to 1945 under PresidentFranklin D. Roosevelt.Chao was unanimously confirmed by the Senate for her appointment as Secretary of Labor.Of Chao's staff,Victoria Lipnic, Assistant Secretary for Employment Standards Administration, later became Member, EEOC and acting chair.In 2004, the department issued revisions of the white-collar overtime regulations under theFair Labor Standards Act.In 2002, a major West Coast ports dispute costing the U.S. economy nearly $1billion daily was resolved when the Bush administration obtained a national emergencyinjunctionagainst both the employers and the union under theTaft–Hartley Actfor the first time since 1971.Led by Chao, in 2003, for the first time in more than 40 years, the department updated the labor union financial disclosure regulations under theLandrum–Griffin Actof 1959, which created more extensive disclosure requirements for union-sponsored pension plans and other trusts to prevent embezzlement or other financial mismanagement.Following theterrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Chao's Department of Labor disbursed grants to provide temporary jobs to assist in cleanup and restoration efforts in New York, as well as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's monitoring of health and safety ofcleanup workbeing performed at the disaster sites including lower Manhattan. The department also provided unemployment insurance and income support to those who lost their jobs in the aftermath of September 11.Following the 2005 hurricane season, which included hurricanesKatrina,RitaandWilma, the Labor Department disbursed nearly $380 million in grants to assist with cleanup work and provide benefits and services to those displaced by the storms. The Occupational Health and Safety Administration and other agencies deployed personnel to the region to provide safety training and uphold workers' rights. Chao set up an emergency response hotline dedicated to the Gulf Coast region for people seeking benefits and worker protection information.After analyzing 70,000 closed case files from 2005 to 2007, theGovernment Accountability Officereported that the Department'sWage and Hour Division(WHD) inadequately investigated complaints from low- andminimum-wageworkers alleging that employers failed to pay thefederal minimum wage, required overtime, and failed to issue a last paycheck.The Department of Labor responded that the GAO investigation focused on individual complaints while the department remained focused on resolving complex and multi-employee complaints; from 1997 to 2007 the annual number of employees receiving back wages as a result of DOL action almost doubled and the dollar amount of back wages paid more than doubled.The Washington Postechoed that Chao's department was criticized by some for \"walking away from its regulatory function\" but also praised by others for providing \"compliance assistance\" and \"helping companies abide by the law\" rather than \"punitive enforcement that … stifles economic growth.\"A 2008Government Accountability Officereport noted that the Labor Department gave Congress inaccurate numbers which understated the expense of contracting out its employees' work to private firms during Chao's tenure, which may have affected 22 employees at the department.Chao and the Bush administration proposed quadrupling the fines imposed against mining corporations for mine safety breaches and sued mine operators for failing to maintain safe working conditions.A 2007 report by the department'sOffice of Inspector General(OIG) found that mine safety regulators did not conduct federally required inspections at more than one in seven of the country's 731 underground coal mines in 2006, and that the number of worker deaths in mining accidents more than doubled to 47 in that year.The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) \"missed 147 inspections at 107 mines employing a total of 7,500 workers\".Mining disasters in 2006 and 2007 included West Virginia'sSago Mine explosion, which killed 12 in January 2006;West Virginia'sAlma Mine fire, which killed two in January 2006;theDarby Mine No.1 explosionin Kentucky, where five miners died in May 2006;and theCrandall Canyon Mine collapsein Utah, which killed six workers and three rescuers in August 2007.Immediately following the Sago mine disaster, Secretary Chao vowed to \"take the necessary steps to ensure that this never happens again\".In 2010, the widows of the two men killed in the Alma Mine fire sued the federal government for wrongful death, citing lack of inspections, failure to act against violations, and conflicts of interest.\"MSHA's review of the fire acknowledged significant lapses by inspectors, supervisors and district managers\" at the mine but the agency did not admit liability for the negligent inspections.In 2013, the appeals court ruled that MSHA can be held liable \"when a negligent inspection results in the wrongful death of a coal miner\".The suit was settled in 2014; MSHA also agreed to develop a training course on preventing fires in underground mines.During her tenure, the Department of Labor achieved \"record low worker injury, illness and fatality rates; record back wages recovered; [and] record monetary recoveries for workers’ pension plans\".A 2009 internal audit appraising anOccupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA) initiative focusing on problematic workplaces for the past six years stated that employees had failed to gather needed data, conducted uneven inspections and enforcement, and failed to discern repeat fatalities because records misspelled the companies' names or failed to notice when two subsidiaries with the same owner were involved; it also noted that after rules changes in January 2008 the number of targeted companies declined by almost half."}

Leading  experts on constitutional law in Russia were also involved. Apackage of amendmentswas prepared, which – unlike the ones proposed by Putin – were intended to strengthenthe 1993 Constitutionand \"implement the idea of expanding the participation of individuals in the life of the state and create a system of authentic people power and the supremacy of the law.\"  Yabloko Party deputies in regional legislative assemblies introduced alternative amendments for consideration by the State Duma.Areferendum on the introduction of amendments to the Constitutionwas held from 25 June to 1 July, in violation of all the legislative norms of the Russian Federation. According to the official results,over 78% of Russian citizens voted for Putin's amendments (on the eve of the referendum,according to the independent polling organisation Levada Center, the alternative package of the amendments drafted the Public Constitutional Council enjoyed the backing of 28% of Russians, while 25% of the respondents said that they supported Putin's amendments). Immediately after the voting, Yavlinsky declared that this was the ill-fated end of the era of post-Soviet modernisation and the start of the destruction of law for the country as a whole.In August Yavlinsky's work\"The Day After.

In 2022, to commemorate the NBA's 75th AnniversaryThe Athleticranked their top 75 players of all time and named Pippen as the 32nd greatest player in NBA history.Much like fellow Bulls teammateMichael Jordan, he provided tenacious on-the-ball perimeter defense, tough interior defense, and significant talent as a help defender. Gifted with extraordinary athleticism, even when compared with other professional athletes, Pippen demonstrated substantial skill in multiple areas well-suited for basketball.Pippen's unusually long arms (with a 2.2 m (88 in) wingspan)and jumping agility helped him clog the passing lanes on defense, block shots from behind on players that had managed to pass him by, grab seemingly out-of-reach rebounds, make unusual plays in mid-air, and make passes around defenders that most players are physically unable to make. He often led the Bulls in assists and blocks as a result. He was also known as a selfless player, and his team-focused approach to the game was a key component in the Bulls' championship wins. Hiscareer assists totalof 6,135 (5.2 per game), which was 23rd all-time among all players when he retired, is a testament to that approach.Pippen's intense work ethic and athletic physique gave him the ability to consistently make highlight-reel plays, such as applying defensive intensity, forcing a turnover, stealing the ball, and starting a one-man fast break that he would finish with a thunderous slam dunk. As he himself has attested, he and Jordan would compete to see who could force more turnovers and produce more offense from defense in each game (fast-break points). During the1990 Slam Dunk Contest, Pippen exhibited his leaping ability with a dunk from the free-throw line. He was an athletic finisher at the rim, both with slam dunks and a skillfulfinger rollthat he added to his skill set over time. He was also a prolific perimeter shooter for the time, taking about 3,000 and making almost 1,000three-pointersin his career.Several NBA players, including Jordan,Jason Kidd,andKarl Malonehave placed Pippen in their all-time starting lineups.In order to commemorate the 20th anniversary of their first NBA Championship in 1991, the Chicago Bulls organization honored the1991 Chicago Bulls Championship teamin a ceremony during halftime of a game versus theUtah Jazzon March 12, 2011. Pippen and Michael Jordan both attended and participated in the celebration, where they were reunited with their former teammatesJohn Paxson,Horace Grant,Stacey King,Craig Hodges,Will Perdue,Scott Williams,Cliff Levingston,Dennis Hopsonand Assistant CoachJohnny Bach. Former head coach Phil Jackson did not participate but gave a speech via a video message. Former Bulls' broadcasterJim Durhamemceed the halftime ceremony.On March 17, 2011, the Chicago Bulls organization announced that they would honor Pippen with abronzestatuewhich will be placed inside of the Bulls' home arena, theUnited Center. He expressed his gratitude by saying: \"Words really can't express my feelings. It's something you dream of as a kid growing up, but you can never foresee those childhood fantasies becoming reality. You see statues of individuals who have done great things and made their mark on history, but as a basketball player, you never really think about arriving at this point. It's an amazing honor for the Chicago Bulls to do this for me.\"The statue was unveiled on April 7, 2011, during a halftime ceremony of a game between the Chicago Bulls and theBoston Celtics."}

Rimland worked as a psychologist at the Point Loma Naval Station,where he remained until 1985.After the birth of his son, Mark, and his subsequent diagnosis of autism around the age of 2, Rimland began researching the disorder. The prevailing theory in the 1950s was that autism was the reaction of children to mothers who were \"cold and distant\". Rimland's personal experience contradicted this idea of \"refrigerator mothers\" and he began searching for alternative explanations.In 1964, Rimland published his book,Infantile Autism: The Syndrome and Its Implications for a Neural Theory of Behavior.In the book, Rimland asserted that autism was not a psychological manifestation caused by unfeeling parents,a widely held belief popularized byBruno Bettelheim.Instead, Rimland suggested, autism was a result of biochemical defects \"triggered by environmental assaults\". He acknowledged that there may also be a genetic component predisposing children to the disorder. Rimland argued that autism could \"be treated—or at least ameliorated—with biomedical and behavioral therapies.\"Infantile Autismchallenged the medical establishment's perceptions of autism.Rimland's message resonated with parents and, after the book was published, he began getting calls and letters from people who wanted to share their stories and ask for advice.In 1965, Rimland founded the Autism Society of America (ASA), a parent advocacy organization, to \"work on behalf of autistic children and their families at local, state and national levels.\"In 1967, Rimland left the ASA to establish the Autism Research Institute (ARI), a San Diego-based non-profit organization dedicated to researching and collecting data on autism and related disorders.He kept a database of research and case histories, as well as conducted and sponsored research in an attempt identify the cause of autism and offer effective treatment solutions. Rimland supported Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA), a systematic educational approach made popular by Ivar Lovaas.He published an ARI newsletter, which reached an international audience.Rimland was also the editor of theAutism Research Review International,published by ARI, which covers biomedical and educational advances in autism research.In 1988, Rimland served as technical advisor on autism for the 1988 movieRain Man. Rimland suggested giving Raymond Babbitt, the movie's main character portrayed by Dustin Hoffman,the extraordinary characteristics of someone withSavant syndrome.Hoffman interviewed Rimland's son, Mark, in preparing for the role.He felt the movie portrayed people with disabilities, and particularly autism, sympathetically.The makers of the movie made a donation of $75,000, intended to go to Rimland's Autism Research Institute.

His papers were confiscated, he was interrogated, twice put in a mental institutionand then arrested. He was charged withsocial parasitismby theSovietauthorities in a trial in 1964, finding that his series of odd jobs and role as a poet were not a sufficient contribution to society.They called him \"a pseudo-poet invelveteentrousers\" who failed to fulfill his \"constitutional duty to work honestly for the good of the motherland\".The trial judge asked, \"Who has recognized you as a poet? Who has enrolled you in the ranks of poets?\" – \"No one\", Brodsky replied, \"Who enrolled me in the ranks of the human race?\"For his \"parasitism\" Brodsky was sentenced to five years hard labor and served 18 months on a farm in the village ofNorenskaya, in theArchangelskregion, 350 miles from Leningrad. He rented his own small cottage, and although it was without plumbing or central heating, having one's own, private space was taken to be a great luxury at the time.Basmanova, Bobyshev, and Brodsky's mother, among others, visited. He wrote on his typewriter, chopped wood, hauled manure, and at night read his anthologies of English and American poetry, including a lot ofW. H. AudenandRobert Frost. Brodsky's close friend and biographerLev Loseffwrites that while his confinement in the mental hospital and the trial were miserable experiences, the 18 months in the Arctic were among the best times of Brodsky's life. Brodsky's mentor,Anna Akhmatova, laughed at theKGB's shortsightedness. \"What a biography they're fashioning for our red-haired friend!\", she said. \"It's as if he'd hired them to do it on purpose.\"Brodsky's sentence was commuted in 1965 after protests by prominent Soviet and foreign cultural figures,includingEvgeny Evtushenko,Dmitri Shostakovich, andJean-Paul Sartreas well as Akhmatova.Brodsky became acause célèbrein the West also, when a secret transcription of trial minutes was smuggled out of the country, making him a symbol of artistic resistance in atotalitariansociety, much like his mentor, Akhmatova.His son, Andrei, was born on 8 October 1967, and Basmanova broke off the relationship. Andrei was registered under Basmanova's surname because Brodsky did not want his son to suffer from the political attacks that he endured.Marina Basmanova was threatened by the Soviet authorities, which prevented her from marrying Brodsky or joining him when he was exiled from the country.[citation needed]After the birth of their son, Brodsky continued to dedicate love poetry to Basmanova.In 1989, Brodsky wrote his last poem to \"M.B.\", describing himself remembering their life in Leningrad:Brodsky returned to Leningrad in December 1965 and continued to write over the next seven years, many of his works being translated into German, French, and English and published abroad.Verses and Poemswas published by Inter-Language Literary Associates in Washington in 1965,Elegy toJohn Donneand Other Poemswas published in London in 1967 by Longmans Green, andA Stop in the Desertwas issued in 1970 by Chekhov Publishing in New York. Only four of his poems were published in Leningrad anthologies in 1966 and 1967, most of his work appearing outside the Soviet Union or circulated in secret (samizdat) until 1987. Persecuted for his poetry and his Jewish heritage, he was denied permission to travel. In 1972, while Brodsky was being considered for exile, the authorities consulted mental health expertAndrei Snezhnevsky, a key proponent of the notorious pseudo-medical diagnosis of \"paranoid reformist delusion\".This political tool allowed the state to lock up dissenters in psychiatric institutions indefinitely. Without examining him personally, Snezhnevsky diagnosed Brodsky as having \"sluggishly progressing schizophrenia\", concluding that he was \"not a valuable person at all and may be let go\".In 1971, Brodsky was invited twice to emigrate toIsrael. When called to theMinistry of the Interiorin 1972 and asked why he had not accepted, he stated that he wished to stay in the country. Within ten days officials broke into his apartment, took his papers, and on 4 June 1972, put him on a plane forVienna,Austria.He never returned to Russia and never saw Basmanova again.Brodsky later wrote \"The Last Judgement is the Last Judgement, but a human being who spent his life in Russia, has to be, without any hesitation, placed into Paradise.\"In Austria, he metCarl Ray Profferand Auden, who facilitated Brodsky's transit to the United States and proved influential to Brodsky's career. Proffer, of theUniversity of Michiganand one of the co-founders ofArdis Publishers, became Brodsky's Russian publisher from this point on. Recalling his landing in Vienna, Brodsky commented:Although the poet was invited back after the fall of the Soviet Union, Brodsky never returned to his country."}

Rimland contended that the vaccination triggered autism by placing a burden on the immune systems of children between birth and age 2.Rimland linked the increase of late-onset autism during the 1980s with the introduction of the MMR vaccine,a correlation the Center for Disease Control, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Medical Association did not support.He rejected the idea that a diagnosis of autism at or around 18 months, the same time the vaccinations were administered, was coincidental.When the California Department of Health Services, along with studies from England and Finland, reported that the vaccine \"plays little or no role in the disease,\" Rimland stated that it was \"much too early to dismiss the [vaccine] hypothesis\".He remained undeterred when a study by Robert L. Davis, published in theArchives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, found no association between MMR and inflammatory bowel disease, discussed in the Wakefield report, \"nor any evidence that the vaccine triggered acute onset of symptoms.\"In 2004, 10 of the 13 co-authors of the Wakefield study withdrew the original interpretation.The United StatesInstitute of Medicine(IOM) in its 2004 report found that, \"the body of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.\"TheMedicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency(MHRA),National Health Service(NHS),World Health Organization(WHO),European Medicines Agency(EMEA),Food and Drug Administration(FDA),Centers for Disease Control(CDC), and many other national and international medical organizations have issued statements of a similar nature, finding no link between autism and thimerosal based on the evidence currently available from a variety of studies."}

His wife, Sandra Newell, suggested modelling theirtea setsince they were sitting down for tea at the time. He sketched the teapot free-hand using graph paper and a pencil.Following that, he went back to the computer laboratory and editedbéziercontrol points on aTektronixstorage tube, again by hand.[citation needed]The teapot shape contained a number of elements that made it ideal for the graphics experiments of the time: it was round, containedsaddle points, had agenusgreater than zero because of the hole in the handle, could project a shadow on itself, and could be displayed accurately without a surface texture.Newell made the mathematical data that described the teapot's geometry (a set of three-dimensionalcoordinates) publicly available, and soon other researchers began to use the same data for their computer graphics experiments. These researchers needed something with roughly the same characteristics that Newell had, and using the teapot data meant they did not have to laboriously enter geometric data for some other object. Although technical progress has meant that the act of rendering the teapot is no longer the challenge it was in 1975, the teapot continued to be used as a reference object for increasingly advanced graphics techniques.Over the following decades, editions of computer graphics journals (such as theACMSIGGRAPH's quarterly) regularly featured versions of the teapot: faceted or smooth-shaded, wireframe, bumpy, translucent, refractive, even leopard-skin and furry teapots were created.Having no surface to represent its base, the original teapot model was not intended to be seen from below. Later versions of thedata setfixed this.The real teapot is 33% taller (ratio 4:3)than the computer model.Jim Blinnstated that he scaled the model on the vertical axis during a demo in the lab to demonstrate that they could manipulate it. They preferred the appearance of this new version and decided to save the file out of that preference.Versions of the teapot model — or sample scenes containing it — are distributed with or freely available for nearly every current rendering and modelling program and even many graphicAPIs, includingAutoCAD,Houdini,Lightwave 3D,MODO,POV-Ray,3ds Max, and theOpenGLandDirect3Dhelper libraries. SomeRenderMan-compliantrendererssupport the teapot as a built-in geometry by callingRiGeometry(\"teapot\", RI_NULL).

Please provide detailed answers with a minimum of 300 words: What is the topic of Christine Chapel's appearances?", "input": "", "output": "In \"What Are Little Girls Made Of?\", it is explained that Chapel abandoned a career in bioresearch for a position inStarfleet. She had hoped that this would reunite her with her fiancé Dr. Roger Korby (Michael Strong), incommunicado following his expedition to the planet Exo III. Five years after Korby's disappearance, Chapel is assigned to the USSEnterprisewhere she serves as head nurse, working under Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley).While on board the ship, she begins to develop feelings forSpock(Leonard Nimoy), admitting as much in \"The Naked Time\". Her actions in that episode resulted in the Psi 2000 intoxication unwittingly being further spread among the crew.The ship reached Exo III in \"What Are Little Girls Made Of?\". Captain Kirk (William Shatner) and Chapel beam down and discover Korby had been exploiting a sophisticated android manufacturing technology on the planet. After Chapel is horrified to find out that Korby had transplanted his personality into an android replica, he kills himself in despair.Roddenberry later co-wrote inThe Making of Star Trekthat the actions of that episode resulted in Chapel breaking her ties to Earth and devoting herself to Starfleet service.After Korby's death, Chapel doubts if she should stay aboard but elects to remain with theEnterprisethroughout the five-year mission.Chapel's feelings for Spock were revisited and alluded to only a few times in the series, most notably in \"Plato's Stepchildren\". In the episode, the Platonians telekinetically force Chapel and Spock to kiss passionately. This humiliates Chapel despite her long-standing feelings for him.In the episode \"Amok Time\", she brings Spock some soup to help him through a sacred Vulcan ritual, thePon farr. He angrily refuses the soup and throws it at the wall, but later thanks Chapel for her thoughtfulness.Chapel appeared in two of theStar Trekfilms featuringThe Original Seriescast. InStar Trek: The Motion Picture, Chapel had become a doctor on board theEnterprise.Her second appearance was inStar Trek IV: The Voyage Home, where she andJanice Rand(Grace Lee Whitney) were stationed in Starfleet Headquarters in San Francisco.In the 2009 filmStar Trek, a Nurse Chapel is mentioned by McCoy (Karl Urban). In the 2013 filmStar Trek Into Darkness, Carol Marcus (Alice Eve) tells Kirk (Chris Pine) that after being with him, Chapel left to become a nurse.Since the start of theStar Trek: Strange New Worldseries in 2022, the Chapel character has appeared in all but one of the episodes in the first two seasons."}
