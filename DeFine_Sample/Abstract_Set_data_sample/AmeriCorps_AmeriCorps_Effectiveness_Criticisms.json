You can feel desperate to crawl out of an underpaid black hole. At a certain point, any opportunity sounds promising. An option you’re likely to encounter is AmeriCorps. This program touts itself as an opportunity to serve your community. I chose AmeriCorps, moved by its outreach. But instead of serving my community, I experienced one of the hardest, most infuriating, and simply awful years of my life — and an experience that no human being should have to endure. I found it to be a program that seeks to provide benefits at the expense of its recruits. My experience is not an anomaly. If you search online about the AmeriCorps program I was part of, VISTA, you will see numerous posts along these lines: “Should I quit before I even get started?” or “I’m almost done with service but I just can’t take it” or “Leaving AmeriCorps 7 weeks early without notice.”These posts, among many others on the internet, are riddled with stories about over- or under-worked members, exploitative job duties, and abusive bosses. AdvertisementVISTA was the part of AmeriCorps I joined. The acronym stands for Volunteers in Service to America, and the program is focused on behind-the-scenes work for nonprofit organizations. VISTA is specifically designed to employ conscientious people to work on the “War on Poverty,” within their respective communities. Its ads describe VISTA as an effort “to strengthen and supplement efforts in low-income communities to eliminate and alleviate poverty by engaging volunteers from all walks of life, all geographical areas, and ...", "score": [0.7234704494476318], "description": "The program intentionally avoids the word “employ” and calls its workers “volunteers,” promising substantial benefits that seemingly outweigh AmeriCorps’ known lack of a livable wage.If you search online about the AmeriCorps program I was part of, VISTA, you will see numerous posts along these lines: “Should I quit before I even get started?” or “I’m almost done with service but I just can’t take it” or “Leaving AmeriCorps 7 weeks early without notice.”These posts, among many others on the internet, are riddled with stories about over- or under-worked members, exploitative job duties, and abusive bosses.The temporary volunteer contract and lack of accountability for nonprofit administrators leaves skilled workers at risk of being exploited.AmeriCorps even offers a travel and “settling-in” stipend for these instances."}, "bc0266858ffcdff860c054569a481ffc": {"id": "bc0266858ffcdff860c054569a481ffc", "meta": {"url": "https://nancyebailey.com/2020/08/30/de-professionalizing-public-schools-during-covid-19-the-problem-with-bill-gatess-projects/", "title": "\"De-professionalizing Public Schools During Covid-19: The Problem with Bill Gates's Projects\".Nancy Bailey's Education Website.", "time": "2020年8月30日"}, "content": "De-professionalizing Public Schools During Covid-19: The Problem with Bill Gates’s ProjectsAugust 30, 2020 By Nancy Bailey 5 CommentsPost Views: 627Many fear that the Gates Foundation is using this pandemic to end public education once and for all. De-professionalizing schools is an excellent way to do it. Covid-19 has made it easier for venture philanthropists to de-professionalize public education. Great public schools require staffing with professionals who attend real universities and study the profession they practice. Public schools are not charities. They must not rely on young people who look at temporarily serving schools like joining the Peace Corps. During this pandemic, it’s not a good move for schools to use online novices to replace professionals, but this is becoming a worrisome trend. Bill Gates argues that high school students need college and career advisement during this difficult time. To his and his foundation’s credit, they’ve provided students with college scholarships. But his foundation is not supportive of public education, as most know. Mr. Gates is now using the college message to fund nonprofits that will provide an influx of temporary online tutors and student success coaches during a looming crisis, a loss of teachers and counselors during Covid-19. He is funding the following nonprofits. College Advising CorpsHigh school students might benefit from hearing about the college experience from college graduates, but they need counselors to help advise them on how to get accepted into college. There is a counselor shortage. For years, counselors have struggled with huge caseloads in overcrowded high schools. Gates looks to be supporting groups that will replace these professionals with temporary full-time advisors who are young college graduates, paid less with little experience. It’s like Counselors for America only; instead, they are called the College Advising Corps. Criticizing counselors isn’t new for Gates.

The allegations are detailed in complaints to the agency's Inspector General, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.AmeriCorps, a network of national service programs, is the largest issuer of grants for service and volunteering.It is overseen by the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), which was established as a federal agency in 1993 – and has been dogged for years by claims that it is poorly managed. Conservative critics say AmeriCorps is a waste of money and promotes liberal causes. The Government Accountability Office found last year that CNCS has fallen short in monitoring whether the organizations it grants money to meet federal standards and requirements.In one recent case, CNCS was slow to respond to allegations of sexual harassment against the founder of one its programs, Impact America. In May 2018, CNCS was alerted to the case by a call to the telephone hotline of its Office of the Inspector General. The complaint reported \"sexually explicit text messages and emails\" were being sent to an AmeriCorps member from a supervisor. It also alleged timesheet fraud. Days before, in a resignation letter obtained by CBS News, the young woman who received the inappropriate messages alleged Impact America president Stephen Black tried to pursue a romantic relationship with her and \"that this kind of attention from him had isolated me from my co-workers and put an enormous strain on me as I tried to distance myself from him emotionally while still carrying out my responsibilities to him as my boss.\"Black, who founded Impact America 14 years ...", "score": [0.8561726212501526], "description": "U.S.AmeriCorps programs accused of sexual misconduct and breakdowns in oversightBySTEVE DORSEYUpdated on:October 22, 2018 / 7:15 PM EDT/ CBS NewsWASHINGTON — A CBS News Radio investigation of years of complaints about AmeriCorps programs has found multiple allegations of sexual harassment, abusive behavior and mismanagement since 2013."}}}}
