Prior to 2011, he persisted in writing articles fiercely critical of the Saleh regime despite being convicted and imprisoned five times for the views expressed in his articles. His daughter was beaten unconscious during his arrest in 2007, and his house was shot at.  In June 2008, he was sentenced to six years in prison for writing critical articles about the war with the Houthis the previous year. He was never told the precise nature of the charge. President Saleh pardoned and released him in September 2008.

The local journalists CPJ spoke with suspected the gunmen are part of the government’s security forces. A silver Toyota SUV carrying six gunmen wearing civilian clothing descended upon Abdel Karim al-Khaiwani, former editor of the online newspaper Al-Shoura, while he was waiting for a taxi outside the offices of the weekly newspaper Al-Nedaa in central Sana’a at around 2 p.m. local time, eyewitnesses told CPJ. The perpetrators forcibly bundled him into the vehicle and sped away, the witnesses said. The witnesses said the license plates of the vehicle were covered with black material. The gunmen blindfolded al-Khaiwani, tied his hands, and took him to the remote village of Mahalein in the Khawlan district, southeast of Sana’a, said Basheer al-Sayed, editorial secretary of Al–Nedaa, who spoke with al-Khawaini after the attack. According to al-Sayed, al-Khaiwani was badly beaten, with several blows to the face and chest. The men threatened him with a pair of shears. They asked him which hand he used for writing and when he told them the left one, they attempted to break his fingers, al-Sayed told CPJ. The gunmen confiscated al-Khaiwani’s passport, identification card, and cell phone, al-Sayed said. The gunmen threatened to kill al-Khaiwani and his family if he writes another word that harms Yemen President Ali Abdullah Saleh or the country’s national unity, CPJ sources said.

The government's increased repression of the media comes in response to growing instability. A five-month rebellion in the North spawned a humanitarian crisis as up to 100,000 civilians in Saada governorate are internal refugees. In the South, protests and demonstrations that began in May are increasing in size and intensity. As hot spots flare across Yemen, the government blocked news Web sites, banned text message news alerts, and refused to grant new newspaper licenses or allow private ownership of broadcast media.

Abdel Karim Al-Khaiwani, forty-two, was unable to attend the ceremony on 17 June 2008 and receive the award in person because just a week earlier he was sentenced to six years in prison for his coverage of armed clashes in the northern Yemeni province of Saada. Al-Khaiwani, former editor of Yemen’s political weekly newspaper and online opposition publication Al-Shora, was one of fourteen Yemenis brought to trial in the case known as ‘The Second Cell of Sana’a’. The defendants are charged with supporting the militant Houthis opposition group, and at least one of them is believed to have been sentenced to death. North and South Yemen were formally unified as the Republic of Yemen in 1990. However, civil unrest has plagued this Arab state, bordering Saudi Arabia and Oman, for a number of years and this has inevitably taken its toll.
