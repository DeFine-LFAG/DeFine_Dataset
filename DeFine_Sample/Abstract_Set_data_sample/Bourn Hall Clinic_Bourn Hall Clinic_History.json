As of 1 May 2009, childless couples in Cambridgeshire,Norfolk,Suffolk,Essex,BedfordshireandHertfordshirewill be able to access up to three cycles ofIVF, plus a further three frozen embryo transfers.A breakthrough that occurred in Bourn Hall’s early days was the application ofcryobiologyto IVF, allowed embryos to be frozen for transfer at a later date. The first \"frozen babies\" were born in 1984. Bourn Hall also led the way in offering in vitro fertilisationsurrogacy. They treated the first couple in the United Kingdom in 1988 and the first IVF surrogacy child was born in 1989.The world’s first baby born as a result of directly injecting a single sperm into the centre of an oocyte was conceived at Bourn Hall. Since this birth in 1992 \"intracytoplasmic sperm injection\" orICSIhas been adopted by IVF clinics around the world.More recently, Bourn Hall pioneered the use ofblastocystculture, where the embryo is grown for up to five days prior to implantation. This increases the chances of IVF success.In 2009, Bourn Hall acquired the former ISIS Fertility Centre in Colchester, Essex which has enabled more convenient access to both NHS and self funded fertility treatments for patients from the Essex and Suffolk regions.In 2010 Bourn Hall Clinic celebrated the award of theNobel Prize for Physiology and Medicineto co-founder ProfessorRobert Edwards.A plaque was unveiled at the Clinic in July 2013 by Louise Brown and Alastair MacDonald—the world's first IVF baby boy—commemorating Steptoe and Edwards.The plaque missed outJean Purdywho had been the person who chose Bourn Hall, was a co-founder of the clinic and an equal partner in developing IVF.

Their work gave childless couples the hope of a baby for the first time and has resulted in 5.5 million IVF babies worldwide.The plaque was unveiled by Louise jointly with Alastair MacDonald – the world’s first IVF baby boy – and his mother, Grace. Also in attendance were Professor Edwards’ wife Ruth, his daughter Jenny and staff from Bourn Hall who worked with Steptoe and Edwards as they translated what was essentially a research programme into a robust clinical practice. The techniques and drugs now used worldwide were first developed in the British clinic.Bob’s daughter Jenny remembers the time before Louise was born.“When dad first started working on this, years before Louise was born, infertility really wasn’t taken that seriously. There was a lot of criticism to overcome and a lot of science to do.“He believed that there was nothing more important in the world than having a child.
