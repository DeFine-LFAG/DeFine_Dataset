The paper, published in the British Journal of General Practice, was co-authored by Professor Azeem Majeed, Imperial College London, and colleagues, including Dr. Bharat Pankhania, Senior Clinical Lecturer at the University of Exeter Medical School. The finding that deaths in doctors is mostly in those aged over 60 raises concerns about the government's campaign to encourage retired doctors to return to NHS Roles. Dr. Pankhania said: \"The data from the Office for National Statistics shows that people from ethnic minorities as well as others who fit a geographical and poverty profile have a higher risk of death following a COVID-19. It is therefore important to profile ALL healthcare staff and thereafter allocate suitable jobs for them, according to their risk profile. Most deaths amongst doctors have occurred in doctors aged 60 years and over. Therefore, it is important to not deploy the returned retired and older doctors in face to face clinical roles. There are many other important roles they can fulfil instead. \"As people with COVID-19 infection can be infective before symptoms start, all healthcare workers who undertake face- to-face clinical work are potentially at risk of infection. It is therefore important to treat all patients as potentially infected and infectious and thus proper PPE should be available in all clinical areas. Patients may be infectious and infect staff and or other patients.\"Reflecting that over 100 health and care workers have died so far from COVID-19 they point out that more deaths are inevitable unless urgent action is taken to reduce the risk.

The government has therefore, called for all hands-on deck including the GPs, community pharmacists and NHS doctors in ensuring that 15 million Britons in the top four priority groups are vaccinated in the next five weeks and that all adults are vaccinated by Autumn this year. While healthcare professionals have welcomed the government’s mass vaccination strategy, they worry around the lack of clarity in the timelines around vaccination of doctors. Most fundamentally, they are concerned if these medics are provided with sufficient financial, emotional and mental support to not burn out in the process.British Medical Association (BMA) council chair Chaand Nagpaul has called on the Government to give urgent priority of vaccination to frontline staff to protect an already depleted workforce and to help prevent the NHS becoming overwhelmed. Dr Nagpaul said, “There are almost 27,000 patients with Covid-19 being treated in hospitals in England – an increase of more than 50 per cent since Christmas Day. Hospitals are becoming like warzones, and healthcare workers are the exhausted foot soldiers on the frontline. GPs are similarly pushed to the limit delivering a mass vaccination programme in the community. All of these workers are at constant risk of becoming infected, yet they are, beyond all doubt, the most important cog in the Covid-19 ‘care machine’.“If they fall ill with the virus and cannot work, there would be no care, no medical procedures and no patients getting better and going home from hospital where they may then need GP care, who are also at huge risk and working often 18-hour days.”Shortage of vaccines in GP-led hubsThe Government ...", "score": [0.7464190125465393], "description": "Health Secretary Matt Hancock has rolled out an ambitious vaccination drive to bring the UK out of the “worst point” of the pandemic as it emerged that 1 in 30 Londoners were infected with Covid-19.In his letter to the Health Secretary, he asked what strategy the Government has had in place to tackle misinformation surrounding the Covid-19 vaccine and encourage take-up in BAME communities.The NHS has been given permission to use a leisure centre in Harrow as a Covid-19 vaccine site to support the rollout over the next year.Tweeting about the vaccination of his grandmother, Councillor Krupesh Hirani wrote, “Just arrived home after taking my 97-year-old grandmother for her second dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine.In a statement, the PSNC said the Department of Health and Social Care and NHS England have agreed to work with community pharmacy bodies “on plans to ensure that community pharmacies are used to maximum effect in the Covid-19 vaccination programme”.It said, “All parties agree on the benefits of using more community pharmacies in the national vaccination effort, recognising that, for some patients, pharmacies will offer a convenient setting in which to be vaccinated in due course.”Commenting on the significance of community pharmacies, National Pharmacy Association chair, Andrew Lane, said, “Pharmacies can play a significant role in the Covid-19 vaccination programme, and we’re well equipped to get started immediately.“We have been on the health service frontline throughout the pandemic and now we want to join this latest, decisive, battle against this deadly virus."}, "103a8471e917bfe2b509520aebbcc04d": {"id": "103a8471e917bfe2b509520aebbcc04d", "meta": {"url": "https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/212973/more-needs-done-protect-ethnic-minority/", "title": "O'Hare, Ryan (21 January 2021).\"More needs to be done to protect ethnic minority groups from COVID-19 | Imperial News | Imperial College London\".Imperial News.

In an analysis, published this month in the BMJ, researchers from the UK and US have reviewed evidence of how systemic racism can exacerbate underlying health inequalities, leading to minority ethnic groups suffering higher rates of mortality and morbidity from the pandemic. The report, from researchers at Imperial, St George’s University, Manchester University and Harvard University, shows that national policies and processes which largely disadvantage ethnic minorities – including areas such as housing, health and employment – have contributed to increased exposure to and worse outcomes from COVID-19 among Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic groups. During the Covid-19 pandemic people from ethnic minority groups have experienced higher rates of infection, serious illness and death. Professor Azeem Majeed School of Public HealthAmong a number of recommendations to redress the balance, they suggest ethnic minority groups could be defined as ‘clinically extremely vulnerable’ to COVID-19, with guidelines devised to consider which patients may be at greatest risk and to reduce their exposure to the disease. Professor Azeem Majeed, from Imperial’s School of Public Health and one of the report authors, explains: “During the Covid-19 pandemic people from ethnic minority groups have experienced higher rates of infection, serious illness and death. Exploring several possible societal causes for these trends, they discuss the impact of racism and discrimination as root causes of health inequalities and increases in mortality and morbidity. COVID-19 has powerfully illustrated that racism is a societal pathogen that is spreading disease and death on a grand scale.
