Gone is the fearsome aura of the ballclub that copped four straight championships from 1993-1996. Big-time players like Dennis Espino, Bal David, Richard Yee, and Dale Singson no longer dominate the UST bench. What is left of the Tigers this season are youthful studs who are out in the hardcourt to give guts-out plays to preserve the pride and the winning tradition the former players left behind. Since the Final Four format was introduced in 1994, the Tigers have always figured as contending semi-finalists. Star-studded or rookie-laden, the Tigers always managed to find a way into the Final Four. This year’s batch of players, however, will be fighting for life as UST’s long and unblemished record in entering the Final Four is in jeopardy. This season, the recruitment program and preparations by universities are tremendous. Unlike in the past where only a handful of teams would contend for the title, this year promises a topsy-turvy hunt for the championship where every team can have a crack at the title because of a surprisingly balanced league. Coach Aric Del Rosario and his rookie-filled crew face a steep season ahead of them, because of the exodus of key players in the team. Their backs against the wall, the Tigers will have to make do as underdogs trying to bite back and to elude the nightmare of missing the Final Four. UnderdogsWhile last season saw a celebrated team that enthusiasts hailed as favorites, this year is quite different for UST.

In their worst start since 1989 when they went 0-4 in their first few games, the Tigers took a free-fall in the early Final Four race as they collapsed in the endgame and fell prey to the feisty National University Bulldogs, 83-80, last August 4 at the Loyola Gym. As the España-based cagers dropped to a 1-4 win-loss record, the pre-season predicament of missing a semifinal stint began seeping into the minds of the Tigers. With the loss, the Tigers plunge to near–cellar, tied with University of the Philippines. UST’s lone victory was over lowly Adamson University, which has yet to get its first win. Also suffering from setbacks against La Salle and UE, the Tigers’ three-game losing skid puts them in a tough position going into the end of the first round as a narrower road lies ahead of them with fewer games and tougher opponents. It was a bitter loss for the Tigers, who lost grip of a game that was virtually theirs after leading most of the way. UST’s cotton-soft character surfaced, as they were limited to a single point, committed five turnovers and went blank in four attempts in the last five minutes of the match. Still ahead by seven with 3:56 remaining, UST crumpled under pressure after the Bulldogs unloaded a deadly 10-0 bite, to steal the game away from the Tigers. Jeff Napa paced the Bulldogs late-game surge unleashing eight of his 21 points in the final period.
