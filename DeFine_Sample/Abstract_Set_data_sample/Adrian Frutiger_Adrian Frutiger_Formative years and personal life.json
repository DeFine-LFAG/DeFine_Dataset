Areas of research are neurobiology, genome regulation, and multicellular systems.Research is carried out in 20 independent but highly interactive[citation needed] research groups. In addition, several cutting-edge technology platforms – including microscopy & imaging, computational biology, functional genomics, proteomics, structural biology and more – support the research activities.
