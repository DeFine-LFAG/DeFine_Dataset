UST was the underdog in the series.It would be the first time that the Tigers and the Eagles met in a UAAP men's basketball final; the last time they have met was in the 1931 NCAA season where the Blue and White dethroned the Gold and White.With several lead changes, the ga came on to the final two possessions. With Ateneo leading by one point, 71–70, J.C. Intal of Ateneo committed a backing violation. UST coach Pido Jarencio then called a timeout to design a play. After the timeout, Jervy Cruz had a hard time penetrating the Blue Eagle defense. He kicked out the ball to a tightly-guarded Allan Evangelista. WithDoug Kramercovering him, Evangelista converted a fadeaway jumper, to put UST up, 72–71, with one second remaining.Ateneo head coach Norman Black (a former varsity player ofSt. Joseph's UniversityinPhiladelphia) sued for time. Devising one the plays he previously used the head coach of the professional teamSan Miguel Beermen, he instructed Chris Tiu to set apickfor Doug Kramer in order to free him from his defender right under the basket. Tigers coach Pido Jarencio (who used to play for Norman Black on his rookie year atSan Miguel Beer, and was a Glowing Goldie, the Tigers previous moniker) instructed his boys to implement theman-to-man defense.Macky Escalona inbounded the ball from the left side of center line. With Tiu setting a pick that separated Japs Cuan from defending Doug Kramer, Escalona passed the ball to the free Kramer and calmly converted his fieldgoal attempt, sending the Ateneo fans into pandemonium.The second game was originally scheduled for September 28, but due toTyphoon Milenyocausing a direct hit toMetro Manilaby the time of the game, the UAAP Board rescheduled the second game to September 30, at theAraneta Coliseum.At the first quarter, the Tigers got off to a hot start, but Ateneo rallied. However, as the quarter concluded, the Tigers hanged on to a one-point lead. The Eagles would lose steam as bad plays and turnovers ruined their offensive flow, while the Tigers began hitting outside shots and grabbing offensive rebounds to negate the Eagles'zone defense. The Eagles would remain within striking distance thanks toJ.C. Intal, but without support from his teammates, Intal's one-man show was not enough as Tigers Dylan Ababou and Jojo Duncil both surpassed the twenty-point barrier, leading into an easy 16-point win.UST opened the game with a 4–0 lead, barely two minutes into the game, before Ateneo countered, using a 6–2 run, with Macky Escalona's fastbreak lay-up to tie the game at 6. Later on, with the game tied at 10, Ateneo ran off five straight points to grab a 15–10 lead, with 3:07 left in the first. The Tigers rallied with a 5–2 burst, cutting Ateneo's lead to two at the end of the quarter.The Blue Eagles started with a 10–4 run to open the second quarter, stretching the lead to eight, 27–19, as well as putting UST in the penalty. The Tigers misfired on their field goals, and their four points were all from the free throw line during this stretch. The Tigers regrouped, rallying to within three at 34–31, before Ken Barracoso hit a three with less than a minute to go in the half, giving Ateneo a 37–31 lead, which they maintained until halftime.UST came out scorching in the third quarter, opening the second half with a 10–0 blitz to grab a 41–37 spread. Dylan Ababou started the burst with a triple from the right wing, then after Clifford Arao turned the ball over in Ateneo's next possession, Jun Cortes found Jervy Cruz under the basket for a lay-up that cut ADMU's lead to one.The Tigers continued to pour it on, scoring five more unanswered points to grab a 41–37 lead, before the Eagles stopped the bleeding with a lay-up by Escalona. However, the Tigers were not done, going on another 7–0 run to stretch their lead to nine, 48–39 with 4:52 left, forcing Ateneo to call a timeout.Ateneo came out aggressive from the timeout, drawing fouls and putting UST in penalty. Cruz, Evangelista, and Duncil were all in foul trouble with 3 each, slowing down their offense, and giving Ateneo more momentum. The Eagles ran off five straight points, and after the Tigers stopped the bleeding, Escalona fired a three-point shot with 1:13 remaining, then after UST came up empty again, drove into the lane from the left wing, converting a lay-up which pushed Ateneo to within 49–51. As the Tigers misfired on their free throws, Ateneo took advantage of this, finishing the quarter with an 11–3 windup, drawing them to within one at the end of the third, 51–50.Neither team could score in the first 3:35 of the quarter until Ababou hit an awkward shot that gave UST the first points of the fourth, as well as a three-point spread. Ateno countered with its four points of its own, and Doug Kramer's basket with 4:46 left gave them back the lead for the first time since early in the third quarter. JC Intal missed two free throws, and Allan Evangelista hit a jumper to swing the lead back to UST.After both teams traded baskets, however, Evangelista fouled out on UST's next possession, and Intal hit a three-pointer, giving the Eagles a 59–57 lead, which Escalona stretched to four later on with a jumper. Duncil then sank a jumper of his own off a crossover dribble to pull the Tigers within two, setting the stage for the crucial final minute and a half of regulation.With less than a minute and a half left in the fourth quarter and his team leading by two, JC Intal drove past Dylan Ababou, drawing Jervy Cruz' fifth and last foul, converting the basket, and setting himself up for a three-point play. After sending Cruz to the bench for good, Intal converted the free throw to give the Blue Eagles a five-point lead, 64–59 with about a minute remaining.With a two of UST's main players out of the game and five-point lead with just over a minute to go in regulation, Ateneo looked poised to end the match. But fate had other things in mind.On UST's next possession, Anthony Espiritu faked his defender into the air then drained a critical triple to draw the Tigers to within two, with just over a minute left in the fourth. Intal drove to the basket in Ateneo's next play, but he missed the shot, and the rebound was controlled by Duncil. On the Tigers' possession, Intal committed a foul, giving UST an inbounds play with clock reading 43.5 seconds. Ateneo then used out of its two timeouts.Duncil caught the pass out of the inbound, but then missed a rushed layup from the right side. However, Mark Canlas grabbed the rebound and scored on a putback to tie the game at 64, with 37.3 seconds left in regulation. The Eagles, opting not to call their final timeout, brought the ball upcourt and isolated Intal at the top of the key. Intal drove into the lane but again missed his lay-up, and the ball was tipped to Duncil. He could not control the rebound, however, and Intal was able to force him to turn the ball over. With only 21 seconds remaining, Ateneo called a timeout to set up their final offensive play of regulation.Intal inbounded the ball to Escalona, who waited until about 11 seconds left before passing it to Chris Tiu, who in turn passed it to Intal on the left wing. He drove into the lane once more, but he again missed the shot, and Japs Cuan threw up a halfcourt shot that missed as time expired. Game 3 had gone into overtime.Both teams started off cold in the overtime period, unable to score on their initial possessions. After Doug Kramer missed a shot on Ateneo's second possession, Japs Cuan brought the ball up and was fouled by Yuri Escueta. Since both teams were in the penalty, this sent UST's floor general to the free throw line. Cuan split his free throws, giving the Tigers a one-point lead.Ateneo came up empty again on their next play, then Kramer fouled June Dizon on UST's possession. Dizon, though, missed both free throws, and Escalona hit another three, giving him 26 points and the Eagles their first lead of the period. Duncil answered right away with a jumper to tie the game again, then after Intal turned the ball over on Ateneo's next possession, Cuan was fouled anew, and once again split his free throws.On the Eagles next possession, Escalona faked his defender into the air then drove into the lane for a difficult lay-up to give the Eagles back the lead, 69–68. Duncil tried to answer on the Tigers' next possession, but he air-balled a three-pointer. Duncil though, chased down his own miss, and drew a foul from Chris Tiu. He then knocked in both shots to swing the lead back to his team.After Escalona missed a three, Ababou stole Kramer's pass and brought the ball into UST's attack zone. Duncil faked off Barracoso behind the three-point arc, then dribbled closer to sink another jumper which gave the Tigers a three-point lead, 72–69, with just over a minute remaining. As the yellow side of the arena grew louder, Chris Tiu sank a three-pointer of his own off an assist pass from JC Intal to tie the game again at 72, forcing UST to call a timeout with 55 seconds left.The Tigers ran an isolation play for Duncil in the right wing against Escalona. Duncil drove into the lane, faked Escalona into the air, then drained yet another jumper to give UST a two-point lead. Intal answered on Ateneo's next play, driving into the lane and laying it in, tying the game anew at 74. The Eagles defended Duncil well on the next play, forcing him to give up the ball to Jun Cortes, who missed an open three. But Ateneo could not control the rebound, and Dylan Ababou grabbed it, drawing a foul in the process. Ababou missed his first free throw, but made the second, giving UST the slimmest of margins, with time down to 12.5 seconds. The Eagles called their last timeout to set up their final offensive play.Barracoso inbounded to Intal, who called for an isolation at the top of the key against Ababou. He drove past Ababou, but missed a short bank shot. As Intal went up for his own miss, Cuan tied him up, forcing a jumpball, with the possession arrow pointing at UST. The Tigers then inbounded to Jun Cortes, who was fouled immediately. Cortes made the first free throw, giving UST a two-point lead, 76–74, with 3.7 seconds left. The second free throw rattled out, and the ball was tipped toJai Reyes, who missed a desperation heave at the buzzer.Macky Escalonatopscored for the Blue Eagles with 26 points, while Jojo Duncil led the Tigers' charge with 18.", "answer_list": [{"answer_sentence": "The Finals series between UST and Ateneo favored the Blue Eagles, as they have figured in more playoff games, and had a championship experience.UST was the underdog in the series.It would be the first time that the Tigers and the Eagles met in a UAAP men's basketball final; the last time they have met was in the 1931 NCAA season where the Blue and White dethroned the Gold and White.With several lead changes, the ga came on to the final two possessions.With Ateneo leading by one point, 71–70, J.C.
