Its author, Trinidadian Ayanna Lloyd Banwo, has appeared on the cover of the Observer as one of its ten best debut novelists of 2022, and the book was named the Most Anticipated Book of 2022 by BuzzFeed and Essence Magazine. The Observer said, “It announces an important new voice in fiction, at once grounded and mythic in its scope and carried by an incantatory prose style that recalls Arundhati Roy’s hugely impactful debut, The God of Small Things (1997), which Lloyd Banwo cites as a major influence.”Based in London, Lloyd Banwo, 41, told WMN the interest in her debut novel has been both surprising and gratifying, since one never knows how people would respond to their work. When we were Birds author, Ayanna Lloyd Banwo says she grew up in a family where stories were always told. -“The only thing you can do is focus on the work you want to do and hope you get enough opportunities to continue to do it. Because it’s not about one book. The hope is to have a long career writing and being able to tell the kind of stories I want to tell.”So she hopes readers will like her future books and that they live up to the hype. “All of this is nice, all of this is lovely, but at the end of the day, the process is still the same.

Robert Jones, Jr., author of The Prophets, calls it “the kind of story that makes you want to spread your arms open wide, embrace the sky, and take flight.” Sold at auction to publishers in the United Kingdom, United States, and Canada in 2020, the novel seems to have followed a gilt-paved path to success, destined to win a ravenous audience: as Hamish Hamilton editor Hermione Thompson says, when it comes to Ayanna Lloyd Banwo, “resistance is futile — prepare to discover your new favourite writer.”Let’s go back to Belmont, first. As Lloyd Banwo reveals, this urban cultural hub in northeast Port of Spain cradled her childhood love of storytelling. “I was always writing because I was always reading, someone was always telling me a story: my grandmother told stories like breathing,” she says, conjuring memories of a fictional realm her grandmother invented, where fruit of every provenance grew magically to the perfect height for diminutively statured devourers. Interwoven with fantasy realms were Granny Yolande Granderson’s very real anecdotes of a Belmont of yore: tales from the 1920s and 30s, the maps of which often loomed larger than life. Trips back from Diamond Vale Government Primary School in Diego Martin led to Yolande’s house, where story was dispensed as both reward and refuge, a practice as instinctive as breathing.When she was eleven years old, ...", "score": [0.7495875358581543], "description": "“I might not have become a writer if I hadn’t gone to UWI,” she says, crediting the pedagogy of professors Gordon Rohlehr and Paula Morgan, as much as the strengths of the university’s robust Literatures in English degree programme itself.“I was utterly amazed that language could do this in a book,” she remembers.“Bocas was the first time I met actual writers, and had a pathway towards getting better at writing,” she reflects, summoning a workshop with David Dabydeen as one of her earliest and most pivotal festival experiences.In the stories she was herself writing, Lloyd Banwo would chase this freedom, this joyful audacity in which creative permission wasn’t something you needed to apply for: you only had to dare it into being.Still, pragmatism and not literary passion typified her early pursuits in career and education alike.In the midst of her careers, her education, and her rootedness, writing as an impetus never vanished."}, "e9150222d2b2a10ebd6a931a8c05cecf": {"id": "e9150222d2b2a10ebd6a931a8c05cecf", "meta": {"url": "https://tt.loopnews.com/content/trinbagonian-author-releases-debut-novel-uk-publishing-house", "title": "abcGall, Tevin (19 January 2022).\"Trinbagonian author releases debut novel with UK publishing house | Loop Trinidad & Tobago\".Loop News.

Is that still the route?”Lloyd Banwo has been based in the UK since 2018, when she relocated to read for an MA in Creative Writing–and subsequently, a PhD–at the University of East Anglia.Between studies, being immersed in writing to meet her publisher’s deadlines and of course, the pandemic, she hasn’t been able to make it back home, and despite the thrill of being added to the growing list of West Indian voices to be internationally published by major houses, Lloyd appears to be most concerned with not forgetting–where she’s come from, and the things and people who anchor her to that place of belonging, both temporal and physical.The business of remembering, of memory, is integral to Lloyd Banwo’s work, much of which is centred on legacy, of the role of ancestors and honouring departed loved ones.Named a “Most Anticipated Book of 2022” by BuzzFeed and Essence Magazine, When We Were Birds tells the story of hapless gravedigger Darwin, estranged from his mother and the Rastafarianism she raised him to follow, and Yejide, whose mother is at the end of her life and from whose lineage of mysticism she is at risk of losing.
