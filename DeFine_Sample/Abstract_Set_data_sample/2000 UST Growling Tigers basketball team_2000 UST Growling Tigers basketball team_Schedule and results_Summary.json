The Tigers have shown inconsistency in their losses due to the absence of aplaymakerafter formerteam captainGelo Velasco's departure from the team. The one advantage that the Tigers have with their inconsistency is in their offense, as no player in their roster made it to the top ten inscoring averages. This trend has left their opponents guessing in terms of defense, as to who they will need to guard more or switch with adouble teamon.Cyrus Baguio missed both his free throws with time running out in regulation, sending the game into overtime with UP at 64–all.

PascoSports EditorVARSITARIANEarly FavoriteUnlike last year, the Growling Tigers are considered to be one of the toughest teams to beat this season. This is due to the fact that their line-up is virtually intact with only play-maker Angelo Velasco leaving the team. Other than that, the same devastating team which wreaked havoc in the last UAAP season will probably dethrone De la Salle University (DLSU) this season. The Tigers' solid frontline composed of team captain Marvin Ortiguerra, Gilbert Lao, Jose Valeriano, Melchor Latoreno and Alwin Espiritu will give their opponents unbearable headaches. The big men will spearhead the brick-wall defense the Tigers will impose on their foes. Being one of last season's leaders in the boards, the Tigers' dominance under the ring will certainly bring much impact in this year's UAAP campaign. The Tigers will also rely on their shifty guards to run their breaks and orchestrate their set-up plays. The flashy combination of Ni�o Gelig and Cyrus Baguio will certainly be a thing to watch-out for as both players add new dimensions into their inside-outside arsenal through their stint as players of the Dazz Dishwashing Paste team in the Philippine Basketball League (PBL). The stinging guard rotation will be completed with ace slotman Emerson Oreta and spit-fire Derrick Hubalde coming off the bench to provide the balanced scoring threat that the Tigers showcased last year.However, the high expectation of the crowd worries UST coach Aric del Rosario. \"Yun nga ang mahirap sa position namin ngayon,\" del Rosario said.

Blowing hot and cold all game long, the Tigers went to their tested stars in the extra period and watched Adamson's Joshua Ramirez fold up from the foul line to seal the pulsating victory at the Rizal Memorial Coliseum.

The Growling Tigers eight win against four defeats temporarily placed them in third spot, just half a game ahead of second-ranked Ateneo. However, UE, which moved closer to elimination with the defeat, placed the game under protest. Coach Itoy Esguerra claimed UST swingman Cyrus Baguio's three-pointer at the end of the first half should not have been counted, claiming the shot came after the half-time buzzer sounded.

The defending champion Archers hiked their elimination round mark to 12 wins and one defeat after making mince meat of winless Adamson , 73-58, at the Rizal Memorial Coliseum. Arch-rival Ateneo, in its strongest showing in years, then snatched a victory from the jaws of defeat, outpointing luckless University of Santo Tomas, 60 - 59, and jeopardizing the Tiger' s own play-off bid. UST is now locked in a tie with University of the East with identical 7-6 win - loss records, while Ateneo improved to 10 - 3, though Far Eastern University can still make a serious bid for the second top spot. The top two Final Four qualifiers will earn the incentives of needing to win only once over their lower ranked rival to advance to the best of three finals. Ateneo slotman Enrico Villanueva had another stellar performance but it was rookie hotshot Magnum Membrere who delivered the killer blows in the dying seconds en route to the gripping victory. With UST ahead 59-58 after a split from the foul line by Cyrus Baguio, Villanueva snared the loose ball, issued it to Wesley Gonzales who spotted the cutting Membrere, who bravely went up for the game winning ...", "score": [0.8056768178939819], "description": "With UST ahead 59-58 after a split from the foul line by Cyrus Baguio, Villanueva snared the loose ball, issued it to Wesley Gonzales who spotted the cutting Membrere, who bravely went up for the game winning lay-up."}, "8178c60f0162545c5c1dced8f1ee0191": {"id": "8178c60f0162545c5c1dced8f1ee0191", "meta": {"url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20010627061505/http://www.pinoycentral.com/img/uaap.nsf/lookup/20000915053", "title": "\"Tigers tear down Bulldogs, 75–70\".PinoyCentral.

A UE victory will force a rubber match between the two winningest UAAP cage squads for the coveted Final Four seat. Del Rosario's prayers were indeed answered in the extra period, as the suddenly defense-oriented Tigers forced Bulldogs to a single point even as Nini Gelig pushed UST ahead on a three-point play, 72-69. It took NU four errors before netting its lone point in overtime from the free throw line, before Marvin Ortiguerra and Cyrus Baguio scored three more from the foul line to seal the hard earned victory. But it was former UST junior standout Emerson Oreta who kept the Tigers in the contest in regulation, knocking in his sixth three-pointer with six seconds left, which sent the game into overtime at 69-all.

The Tigers, who like the warriors own 18 UAAP cage titles, faces a bigger task this Sunday when they clash with defending champion De La Salle, which needs to win only once to make it to the championship round. \"Inunahan na namin sa simula at yun nga, nong humabol na ang UE may lamang na kami kaya di rin sila nakalamang\" said an overjoyed UST coach Aric del Rosario. \"Siguro ngayong nakapasok na kami sa Final Four, mas lalong tataas ang level ng laro ng mga bata, iba na ito, eh malapit na sa Finals\" added del Rosario, who in the past lamented his wards' often individualistic plays.

The Archers, the seniors division champion the past two seasons, lost as much as a 13-point lead but still came out on top as the Tigers blew at least eight chances to chop the gap further or pull abreast in the crucial homestretch. La Salle faces the winner of the rubber match between Far Eastern University and arch-rival Ateneo this Thursday. Armed with a twice to beat edge, the Blue Eagles got nipped by FEU 61-60 last Saturday to force the sudden death duel. The Growling Tigers, given up for lost after trailing by 11, 49-38 early in the final period, suddenly gained ground with Derrick Hubalde drilling three straight triples to close in at 52-54, nine minutes left. But such was to be the UST five's last show of resistance, as six straight misses countered by a 7-0 La Salle run dimmed the Tigers' chances. High-flying UST forward Nino Gelig, shut down in the first half, clustered three points for a 62-65 count, followed by another wasted opportunity by the Tigers to tie the count.
