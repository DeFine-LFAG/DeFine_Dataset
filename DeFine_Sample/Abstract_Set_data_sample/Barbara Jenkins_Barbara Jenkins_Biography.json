This talented septuagenarian and Trinidadian native is a retired high school geography teacher. At the urging of friends she joined a writers’ group, which eventually led to her returning to school to complete an MFA in creative writing at UWI St. Augustine. Sic Transit Wagon, and Other Stories is the product of this graduate program. Sic Transit Wagon, and Other Stories is a collection of twelve semiautobiographical tales divided into three sections, roughly corresponding to youth, midlife, and old age. These are unashamedly women’s stories that take us on a journey through the eyes of a girl-child living in poverty, continue with wives and mothers in postcolonial suburbs, and end with older women dealing with aging and their dying partners. Jenkins’s spare prose and emotionally mature style create a wonderfully clear picture of colonial and postcolonial Trinidadian life. Jenkins does an almost pitch-perfect job with the Port-of-Spain accent, and it would take a nuanced ear to find those very few places that do not ring true. The humor and compassion that run through all the stories make up for anything lacking in one or two of them.
